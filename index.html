        <p>
          I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early
          adult life, cooking dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner
          or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
          until I got married that I started eating real food because I married
          a guy who cooks. I started joining him in the kitchen and realized
          that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And
          gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!
